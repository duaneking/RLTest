Just a collection of Roguelike level generators.

Level types: Nethack-Style, BSP Tree, Big Honkin Room, 2 Cellular Automa "caverns", and a randomly sized cross

Line of Sight!

Fast A* pathfinding

Levels have a bunch of base-line attributes that any roguelike would need.

THIS IS RELEASED UNDER THE "DON'T BE A DICK" LICENSE

You can use this stuff for whatever you want, but please don't
pass it off as your own work. I'd appreciate a "Thank you: Pass the Dice" at least!


Want to add some changes? Have a cool new level type? Etc?
Create a fork, get to work, and let me know what you come up with!
